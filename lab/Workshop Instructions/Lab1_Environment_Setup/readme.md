- Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace
 

## Lab Outline

### Set up the environment for the workshop

- Create Azure Machine Learning workspace
- Request GPU quotas in Azure subscription
- Set up the project and install the libraries
- Set up project files in Visual Studio Code
 
### Create Azure Machine Learning workspace

Type azure machine learning in the search bar at the top of the portal page and select Azure Machine Learning from the options that appear.

![](/lab/Workshop%20Instructions/Lab1_Environment_Setup/images/01-1-type-azml.png)

Select + Create from the navigation menu.

Select New workspace from the navigation menu.

![](/lab/Workshop%20Instructions/Lab1_Environment_Setup/images/01-2-select-new-workspace.png)

Perform the following tasks:

- Select your Azure Subscription.
- Select the Resource group to use (create a new one if needed).
Enter Workspace Name. It must be a unique value.
- Select the Region you'd like to use.
- Select the Storage account to use (create a new one if needed).
- Select the Key vault to use (create a new one if needed).

![](/lab/Workshop%20Instructions/Lab1_Environment_Setup/images/01-03-fill-AZML.png)

> [!TIP]
> When you create or use a Storage account in Azure Machine Learning, a container named "azureml" is automatically created within the Storage account. This container is used for storing model artifacts, training outputs, and other data generated during the machine learning process. In this tutorial, you will use the "azureml" container to manage and store all the necessary files and outputs related to our machine learning workflows.

 
- Select Review + Create.

- Select Create.


### Request GPU quotas in Azure Subscription
 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to fine-tune and deploy a Phi-3 model, using GPUs. For fine-tuning, you will use the `Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 GPU`, which requires a quota request. 

For deployment, you will use the `Standard_E4s_v3 CPU`, which does not require a quota request.

> [!NOTE]
> Only Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions (the standard subscription type) are eligible for GPU allocation; benefit subscriptions are not currently supported.


### Request GPU Quotas in your Azure Subscription
 
Request GPU Quotas in Azure Subscription

- Visit [Azure ML Studio](https://ml.azure.com/).

Perform the following tasks to request `Standard NCADSA100v4` Family quota:

- Select Quota from the left side tab.
- Select the Virtual machine family to use. For example, select `Standard NCADSA100v4 Family Cluster Dedicated vCPUs`, which includes the `Standard_NC24ads_A100_v4 GPU.`
- Select the Request quota from the navigation menu.

![](/lab/Workshop%20Instructions/Lab1_Environment_Setup/images/01-04-request-quota.png)

- Inside the Request quota page, enter the New cores limit you'd like to use. For example, 24.

- Inside the Request quota page, select Submit to request the GPU quota.

> [!NOTE]
>You can select the appropriate GPU or CPU for your needs by referring to Sizes for Virtual Machines in Azure document.

 
### Add role assignment

To fine-tune and deploy your models, you must first ceate a User Assigned Managed Identity (UAI) and assign it the appropriate permissions. 

This UAI will be used for authentication during deployment, so it is critical to grant it access to the storage accounts, container registry, and resource group.

### Set up the project and install the libraries

Now, you will create a folder to work in and set up a virtual environment to develop a program.

In this exercise, you will

- Create a folder to work inside it.
- Create a virtual environment.
- Install the required packages.

### Create a folder to work inside it

- Open a terminal window and type the following command to create a folder named finetune-phi in the default path.

```bash
mkdir finetune-phi
```

- Type the following command inside your terminal to navigate to the finetune-phi folder you created.

```bash
cd finetune-phi
```
 
- Create a virtual environment

- Type the following command inside your terminal to create a virtual environment named .venv.

```Bash
python -m venv .venv
````

- Type the following command inside your terminal to activate the virtual environment.

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```
 
> [!NOTE]
>If it worked, you should see (.venv) before the command prompt.

 
### Install the required packages

Type the following commands inside your terminal to install the required packages.
  
  ```bash
pip install datasets==2.19.1
pip install transformers==4.41.1

pip install trl==0.9.4
pip install promptflow==1.12.0
``` 

### Set up project files in Visual Studio Code

In this exercise, you will create the essential files for our project. These files include scripts for downloading the dataset, setting up the Azure Machine Learning environment, fine-tuning the Phi-3 model, and deploying the fine-tuned model. You will also create a conda.yml file to set up the fine-tuning environment.

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a download_dataset.py file to download the dataset.
Create a setup_ml.py file to set up the Azure Machine Learning environment.
- Create a fine_tune.py file in the finetuning_dir folder to fine-tune the Phi-3 model using the dataset.
- Create a conda.yml file to setup fine-tuning environment.
- Create a deploy_model.py file to deploy the fine-tuned model.
- Create a integrate_with_promptflow.py file, to integrate the fine-tuned model and execute the model using Prompt flow.
Create a flow.dag.yml file, to set up the workflow structure for Prompt flow.
Create a config.py file to enter Azure information.
