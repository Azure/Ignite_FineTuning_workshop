# Lab 2. Data Preperation
## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **15-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for data preparation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to: 
1. Use GPT-4 To create synthetic data based on a known scenario.
1. Prepare a dataset for fine-tuning with Azure AI Studio.
1. Verify that the datasets.
1. Understand the importance of the dataset preparation process.

## Lab Scenario
This lab will guide you through the process of creating data set for use in fine tuning experiementation. In this lab, you will prepare the dataset for fine-tuning. You will create and deploy a GPT model to create a synthetic data. In option2 you will download a known dataset using python to your local environment.

## Lab Outline
This lab comprises the following exercises:

- Create a GPT-4 OpenAI Deployment
- Option1. Create synthetic data using GPT-4 
    - Create a prompt to create synthetic data and save this as in jsonl format.
- Option 2. Prepare Dataset for Fine-tuning from a known Data Set. 

## Deploy a model

Azure provides a web-based portal named **Azure AI**, that you can use to deploy, manage, and explore models. You'll start your exploration of Azure OpenAI by using Azure AI Hub and Projects to deploy a model.

> **Note**: As you use Azure AI, message boxes suggesting tasks for you to perform may be displayed. You can close these and follow the steps in this exercise.

1. Within your current Azure AI project, in the left hand pane, select the **Deployments**. Create a new deployment of the **gpt-4** model with the following settings:
    - Select **+Deploy Model**
    - Select **Deploy base model**
    - Select **Gpt-4** and select confirm
    - **Deployment name**: *A unique name of your choice*
    - **Model version**: *Use default version*
    - **Deployment type**: Global Standard
    - **Tokens per minute rate limit**: 10K\*
    - **Content filter**: DefaultV2
    - Select **Deploy**

    > \* A rate limit of 10,000 tokens per minute is more than adequate to complete this exercise while leaving capacity for other people using the same subscription.

## Use the Chat playground

Now that you've deployed a model, you can use it to generate responses based on natural language prompts. The *Chat* playground in Azure AI provides a playground chatbot interface.

1. Select **Open in playground**
1. In the **Playground** section, select the **Chat** page. The **Chat** playground page consists of a row of buttons and two main panels (which may be arranged right-to-left horizontally, or top-to-bottom vertically depending on your screen resolution):
    - Left hand side Menu Option **Deployment** and **Give the Model Instruction and Context** - used to select your deployment, define system message, and set parameters for interacting with your deployment.
    - **Chat session** - used to submit chat messages and view responses.
1. Under **Deployments**, ensure that your gpt-4 model deployment is selected.
1. Create a default **System message**, which should be ```You are an AI assistant that helps people find information.``` The system message is included in prompts submitted to the model, and provides context for the model's responses; setting expectations about how an AI agent based on the model should interact with the user.
1. Select **Apply Changes** to save the system message
1. In the **Chat session** panel, enter the user query `How can I use generative AI to help me market a new product?`

    > **Note**: You may receive a response that the API deployment is not yet ready. If so, wait for a few minutes and try again.

1. Review the response, noting that the model has generated a cohesive natural language answer that is relevant to the query with which it was prompted.
1. Enter the user query `What skills do I need if I want to develop a solution to accomplish this?`.
1. Review the response, noting that the chat session has retained the conversational context (so "this" is interpreted as a generative AI solution for marketing). This contextualization is achieved by including the recent conversation history in each successive prompt submission, so the prompt sent to the model for the second query included the original query and response as well as the new user input.
1. In the **Chat session** panel toolbar, select **Clear chat** and confirm that you want to restart the chat session.
1. Enter the query `Can you help me find resources to learn those skills?` and review the response, which should be a valid natural language answer, but since the previous chat history has been lost, the answer is likely to be about finding generic skilling resources rather than being related to the specific skills needed to build a generative AI marketing solution.

## Prepare Dataset for Fine-tuning

### Using GPT to create synthetic Data 


Based on LLM context you need to provide prompt templates based on the requirements here are some examples:

In the playground in the **Setup** menu ensure max repsonses are set to **4096**

To undertake fine tuning we recommed you create 60 samples. To get 60 samples you may need to do a few back an forth with the model and ensure **Max response token to 4096 and specify you need 60 sample**.   

Simply copy and paste the output json into a notepad and save the file as `data_sample.jsonl` .jsonl` is the format required for fine tuning experiementation.
