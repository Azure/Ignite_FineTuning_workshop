# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a lab that will give you a hands-on introduction runing evaluations with AI Tooklkit. To ensure that the model remains safe and effective, it's important to evaluate it. This evaluation helps to assess the model's potential to generate harmful content and its ability to produce accurate, relevant, and coherent responses.

## Learning Objectives

You will learn how to evaluate the safety and performance of a fine-tuned model using AI Tooklot.

## Lab Scenario
Introduction to Azure AI Toolkit evaluation
- Introduction to safety evaluation
- Introduction to performance evaluation
