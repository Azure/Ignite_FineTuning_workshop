## How To Use

Welcome,

> [!NOTE]
>This repository contains the resources needed to deliver the session "Fine-Tuning NLP Models with Microsoft Olive" at Microsoft Ignite 2024.
> The following resources are intended for a presenter to learn and deliver the session.

We're glad you are here and look forward to your delivery of this amazing content. As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It will provide you a full run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team. 

Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and demo instructions &
code.

> [!NOTE]
> Read document in its entirety, watch the video presentation, ask questions of the Lead Presenter

## Get Started

This repository is divided in to the following sections:

| [Slides](https://aka.ms/..) | [Skillable Workshop Instructions](/lab/Skillable%20Workshop%20Instructions/00_Introduction.md) | [Non-Skillable Workshop Instructions](/lab/README.md) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------
| ** slides - 4 Hours minutes| 10 Labs - 180 minutes | Running the workshop outside Skillable |

## Slides

The [slides](https://aka.ms/...) have presenter notes in each part of the session

### Timing

For workshops, Q&A usually happens as the workshop is running. Might scrape these 5 minutes in favor of more hands-on time.â€‹

## Workshop Instructions on Skillable Lab On Demand

| Lab # | Title | Description |
| ----- | ------ |----------- |
| 1 | Set up | Learn how to set-up your Azure resources and local environment for this lab. |
| 2 | Data Prep | Learn how to prepare data for Finetuning and evaluation. |
| 3 | Finetuning with Azure AI Studio | Learn how to finetune with Azure AI Studio - both an Azure OpenAI model, and an OSS Model using the Olive CLI. |
| 4 | Deploying models to a cloud endpoint | Learn how to deploy models to a cloud endpoint for inference using Azure AI Studio. |
| 5 | Optimize your model for Inference using Microsoft Olive | Learn to optimize your model for on-device inference using Olive. This will include quantization methods and ONNX runtime optimizations. |
| 6 | How to evaluate AI models | In this lab we show you how to evaluate your models to ensure they give trustworthy and safe responses. |
| 7 | Bring it all together in an app | In this lab we build an application that consumes the AI models you trained and optimized in previous labs. The application will call 2 different models: 1 model will be in the cloud and the other will be on-device. |
| 8 | Clean up | In this lab, we clean up all the resources.
