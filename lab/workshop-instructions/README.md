| Lab # | Title | Description |
| ----- | ------ |----------- |
| 1 | Set up | Learn how to set-up your Azure resources and local environment for this lab. |
| 2 | Data Prep | Learn how to prepare data for Finetuning and evaluation. |
| 3 | Finetuning with Azure AI Studio | Learn how to finetune with Azure AI Studio - both an Azure OpenAI model, and an OSS Model using the Olive CLI. |
| 4 | Deploying models to a cloud endpoint | Learn how to deploy models to a cloud endpoint for inference using Azure AI Studio. |
| 5 | Optimize your model for Inference using Microsoft Olive | Learn to optimize your model for on-device inference using Olive. This will include quantization methods and ONNX runtime optimizations. |
| 6 | How to evaluate AI models | In this lab we show you how to evaluate your models to ensure they give trustworthy and safe responses. |
| 7 | Bring it all together in an app | In this lab we build an application that consumes the AI models you trained and optimized in previous labs. The application will call 2 different models: 1 model will be in the cloud and the other will be on-device. |
| 8 | Clean up | In this lab, we clean up all the resources.
